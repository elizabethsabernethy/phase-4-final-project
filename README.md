# Phase 4 Final Project: Off the Arts

This project utilized create-react-app to structure a basic react website, which I adjusted to meet the specific parameters for the app I wanted to create. I also forked and cloned a backend Ruby repository from the Flatiron school (https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/project-template-react-rails-api) and added the required migrations and request routes in the application controller to allow an easy connection between the frontend and backend. Function-based components are the primary features of React which this app uses to create the optimal user experience. The backend utilizes Ruby on Rails to create enhanced functionality primarily through validations and serializers.  

## Purpose of Project

The purpose of this website is to act as a platform for users to post their paintings. Non-account holders are able to view the homepage, as well as the museums page, in which they are able to further view respective paintings and artists associated with the museums. The primary focus of the website however requires a user to have an account. Through having an account, a user can add paintings, edit their respective paintings, delete their paintings, and even add museums if their paintings are featured somewhere not already listed. 

When a user first enters the website, they will see the Off the Arts homepage. Here they are able to view the navigation bar which houses the home tab, the museums tab, and a button for users to login (or sign-up). As mentioned before, if not logged into an account, the only thing a user can do is interact with the featured museums.

Once they have viewed the respective artists, and paintings for whichever museums they desired, they may decide to sign-up or log into their account.

Once logged in, a user is taken to their profile page. Here they can view their paintings, add paintings, and see the museums their paintings are currently featured in. Being logged in also allows users to add museums, if they navigate back to the museums page. Both adding a painting and a museum have similar functionality and are added without the need for a page refresh. The primary difference between paintings and museums, however, is the capability to edit and/or delete paintings. When a painting is added, edited, or deleted, these changes are reflected both in the user's profile, as well as the museum which houses the painting.

Once the user is finished with whatever they're doing, they can click the logout button, and they will return to the homepage.
